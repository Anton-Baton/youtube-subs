 this presentation is delivered by the Stanford center for professional development ok good morning are welcome to CS 229 the machine there any class so what I want to do today is just go over to spend a lot of time going over the logistics for the cost and then we'll start to talk about machine learning arm by way of introduction my name is Andrew - I'll be instructor for this class and so personally working machine learning that worked on it for about 15 years now and I actually think the machine learning is that you're the most exciting few the ball of computer science oh so much she always excited about teaching this class of sometimes actually think that machine learning is not only the most exciting theme computer science but the most exciting thing in all of human endeavor so maybe a little by is there of also wanted to use the TAS who are all graduate students doing research in a related to the machine learning in our experts in machine learning on palm stock is armed work the machine learning computer vision on Katie Chang is that here neuroscientist who applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand human brain Tom dogs and other PhD student works in computational biology and in so the basic fundamentals of him learning armsie Colter is the head ta are missed seeing is here two years in a row now we're also machine learning and applies them to a bunch of robots and down your Ramage is armed this is not here Daniel applies learning algorithms to problems in natural language processing arm so you get to know the tears and me much better for this quarter but just from you know the sort of things the TS do i hope you know retail the machine learning is a highly interdisciplinary on topic in which with just that he is applying there any hours of problems in computer vision and biology and roll bars and language arm and machine known as all those things that has had and is having a large impact on many applications so of just in my own daily work I actually frequently end up talking to people that helicopter pilots to biologists have you can computer systems or databases to economic and there's sort of all also you an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford interested in flying machine learning problems interesting the fine machine learning methods to their own problems so on yeah this is fun couple of weeks ago students actually for the to be an article on a computer world about the tough IT skills that employees and employers can say no to sort of about that you know so the top most desirable skills and all of IT and all of information technology and topping the list was actually machine learning so I think there's a good time to be learning this stuff and and learning algorithms are having a large impact on many segments of science and industry of i'm a curious about something arm learning our rooms and other things that touch as many areas of science and industry so it's kinda curious how many people here are computer science majors are in the computer science department okay about half of you how do you figure out from e.e oh ok about all if I'm honey biologists are there here wow just a few not many surprise anyone for statistics ok a few also where where the rest of you from what's a game I see me cool see and what else since this device systems you call me Jimmy cool air ask you yes right yeah ok call anyone else part of ms any alright cool yeah so problem and though she was in this at the industry okay all right great yeah says you can tell them from from from a cross section of this class I think we're very diverse audience in this room and there's some other things that on makes the class fun to teach and fun to be and I think um so this last try to convey to you a broad set of principles and tools that will be useful for doing many many things arm and every time I teach this class i can actually very confidently say that are after December no matter what you're going to do after this December when you have completed this class you will find the thing to learn in this class is very useful and and and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end up doing later in your life arm so i have more than just sex to go over later but let's say a few words about machine learning on a few the machine learning throughout of early work in AI or early work in artificial intelligence and off the loss I want to say lost 15 on the last 20 years or so it's been view there's the of drawing new capability for computers arm and in particular it turns out that the many programs are there many applications that you can't program by hand for example if you want to get the computer to read have written characters to meet of harriton digits that it turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of software to taken it to take this input an image of somebody that i wrote and figure out you know just what it is to translate my my my cursive handwriting into armed into into him to extract the characters up I wrote out in longhand arm and other things will one thing that my sins and I do is autonomous place so it turns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter on in contrast if you want to do things like these the right to get software 25 helicopter i have software recognize her more than just its arm one very successful approach is to use the learning algorithm and have a computer learned by itself how to say recognized your handwriting on and the fact that hammer and a generic recognition this is pretty much the only approach that works well and you sort of applications that the hard to program by hand are learning our rooms has also made I guess second in roles in what's sometimes called of database mining arm so for example with the growth of IT and computers are increasing the many hospitals are keeping around medical records of you know what's all the patients what problems they had what the probabilities whereas what the outcome was and taking all of these medical records which started to be started to be digitized only about me 15 years ago are applying the only hours to them we can turn raw medical records into when I lose the car medical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical patterns and even start to alter medical practice as a result of our medical knowledge that's arrive by applying the album's to the medical not by applying learning algorithms to the source of medical not records that hospitals have just been building over the last you know 15 20 years in electronic format um turns out that most of you probably used learning our rivers i know i think half a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen times they are more on and often without knowing it so for example every time you send me or by the US postal system armed turns out there's a album that tries to automatically right read zip code you wrote on your envelope and that's done following so every time you send us mail you're using a learning our phone perhaps even with perhaps without even being aware of it um similarly every time you write a check I actually don't know the number for this but the second fraction of checks that you write our process by a learning algorithm that's learn to read the digits of the dollar amount that you wrote down your checks every time you write a check there's another learning algorithm that you're probably using without even being aware of it um if you think if you use a credit card or I know these one phone company was doing this and and lots of companies like TV as well did that do electronic transactions there's a good chance that there's a learning our room in the back and try to figure out if so your credit cards been stolen or of someone's engaging in the fraudulent transaction if you use the website right like on Amazon and Netflix that you know often recommend on boxee to buy a movie studio to rent or whatever these are other examples of learning algorithms that have learned what sorts of things you like to buy one of those movies you like to watch and can therefore give customized recommendations to you armed I know just the other week ago I had my car servers and even their my my my car mechanic was trying to explain to me some learning algorithm and the innards of my car there's the doing as best optimize my driving performance and fuel efficiency or something so i think most of us learned most of us use learning algorithms you know half a dozen a dozen maybe dozens of times without even knowing it arm and of course learning our was also doing things like giving us a growing understanding of the human genome so if someday where the find a cure for cancer of that during the hours will have had a large role in that that's one of the things that Tom work arm so in teaching this class arm I have a soy-free goes on one of them is just to help convey some of my own excitement about machine learning to you arm the second go is by the end of this clause i hope all of you will be able to apply say that the arts machine learning algorithms arm to whatever problems you're interested in and if you ever need to build a system for right for reading zip codes do you know how to do that by the end of this class arm and lastly by the end of the count this cause I realize that only a subset of you are interested in doing research and machine learning but by the conclusion of this clause i hope that all of you actually be well qualified to start doing research in machinery arm so see if us about logistics arm the prerequisites of this class are written on the unknowns of one of the handouts are as follows this has been going to assume that all of you have the basic knowledge of computer science and basic knowledge of the basic computer skills and principles so i'll see you all of you know what Big O notation is that all you know about the data structures IQs stacks binary trees and they're all of you know enough programming skills to write you know they write a simple computer program oh it turns out that arm most of this class will not be very programming intensive although we will do some programming mostly need a math lab or RT C bit more about that later also assume familiarity with basic probability and statistics so most undergraduate statistics class likes that won 16 Torres Sanford will be more than enough I'm going to see what all of you know what random variables are they all you know what expectation is what the variance of around the variable is armed and if in case of some of you has been a while since you've seen some of this with hero at some of the discussion sections will actually go over some of the prerequisites on serve as a refresher course on the prereqs applause let's say it's a bit more about that later as well armed lost the also assume familiarity with basic linear algebra and again most undergraduate than the algebra classes are more than enough so if if you taken classes like math 51 one of the field math 113 or CS 2 or 5 Stanford that would be more than enough our visit will assume that all of you know what matrices and vectors are that you know how to multiply matrices and vectors and multiple images of matrices you know where the matrix inverses if you know when an eigenvector of a matrix is that even better but if you don't if you don't quite know if you're not quite sure that's fine - we'll go over in the review sections so arm this one more the couple more logistical things i should do you live in this awesome um one is that arm as most of you know cs2 29 is televised clause and the fact that guy's many of you are probably watching this you know at home on TV is I'm gonna say hi to our home viewers are so earlier this year I approach SCPD the which wich tell advisors these classes about trying to make a small number of standard classes publicly available for posting the videos on the web arm and so this year Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which will post videos of a small number of causes online arms up on the Internet in a way that makes a publicly accessible to everyone no I'm okay I'm very excited about that because this machine there any other schools get the word out there oh one of the consequences of this is that let's see so videos of pictures of the students in this classroom will not be posted online so so your images so they're worried about being surprised by seeing your own face up here on YouTube one day on but the microphones may pick up your voices so arm so so so i guess the consequence of that is that you know because microphones me a pic of your voices are no matter how irritated yarny don't yell out swear words in the middle of cars arm but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces everything and that want to show okay um let's see also handed out this from the two handles at home most of you have from course information handout so let's just say a few words about parts of these arm on the third page there's a section that says online resources yeah ok Oh louder ok actually a good turn of the volume testing is this better testing testing perfect thanks so um right online resources the classes the home page is written on the handouts I won't write on the on on the chalkboard HCPCS between I understand that edu and so on when there are homework assignments or things that we we usually won't bring if India mission of saving trees we will I'm usually not give up many handles and class arm so homework assignments home solutions will be posted online other at the at the course homepage um that's how this clause have also written and against them also provides every year a set of fairly detailed lecture notes they cover the technical content of this class and so because the course homepage you'll also find the detail lecture notes that sort of cover of you know that go over in detail all the math and the equations and so on that i'll be doing cause there's also a newsgroup as you got class starts yes - 29 also written the handouts on this is a newsgroup that's sort of a farm for people in the class to you know get to know each other and have whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourself I'm so the class news group will not be monitored by the tears and me on but this is place you to your form study groups to find project partners or discuss their problems and so on I mean it's not monitored by the tears and meet so so you can also feel free to talk trash about this class their home on if you want to contact the teaching staff please use the email addresses are written down here at CES 2009 - QA at CSR stanford.edu on this goes to the count is read by all the tears and ease of so rather than sending us e-mail individually with an email to this account will actually let us get baths you are you maximally quickly you have answers your questions um if you're asking questions about how our problems please stay in the subject line which assignments and which question the email refers to since that will also help us to route your question to the appropriate TA or to me appropriately and get a response back to you quickly um let's see skipping ahead let's c is for worth one midterm 1 over the Internet project notes on the honor code so one thing that I think will help you to succeed and do well and disclose and even help you enjoy this class more is on every form a study room so we can start looking around where you're sitting hour and then at the end of class today are you know mingle a little better than getting to know your classmates are my strongly encourage you to form study groups in and so have a group of people just study weapon and have proof of your fellow students to talk over these concepts with you can also post on the class newsgroup if you want to use that to try to form a study group but some of the problem says on this in this class are reasonably difficult armed people have taken out before me tell you a very difficult on and and just I think oh I bet would be more fun for you and you probably have a better learning experience if you have a small if if you form a study group of people to work with so definitely encourage you to do that um and don't say a word on the honor code which is that on that encourage you to form a study group at work together and discuss her problems together oh but if you discuss her problems with other students do not ask you to arm to go home and write down your own solutions independently without referring to notes that were taken any of your joint study sessions so in other words when you turn the whole world problem what you turn it should be something that was reconstructed you know independently by yourself and what about referring to those that you took during your study sessions of other people ok and obviously you know showing your solution to others are copying other solutions directly is right out on location also we use problems and questions from previous years that so that the problems are a bit more debug then and and work more smoothly and as a result of that I also asked you not to look at some solutions from previous years and this includes spoke so official solutions that we given out to previous generations of this cause and on previous solutions that you know people that are taking this class in previous years may have written up by themselves okay um sadly in this clause there are usually sadly in previous years they have often been a few all the code violations in the schools and last year i think i prosecuted five on the correlations which i think is a ridiculously large number and so just don't look at those solutions and and and hopefully they'll be 0 on the code violations this year i love for that to happen um the section here on the late homework policy if you ever want to hand in the homework late i'll leave you to redeem yourself um we also have a midterm which will which is scheduled for the thursday eighth of november at 6pm so please keep that arm so please keep that evening free and arm let's see and one more at 11 most mr. thing i want to say is about a class project um so probably go of this class is so that if you well equipped to apply machine learning algorithms to a problem or to do research on machine learning and so as part of this clause so I asked you to execute a small research project so it is a small term project um and what most students do for this is either apply machine learning to problem that you find interesting or investigate some aspects of machines everything so don't see you there are either already doing research on to those of you who are in industry are taking this from from from a company are one fantastic so way to do a class project would be if you apply machine learning algorithms to a problem there you're interested in on to a problem that you're already working on you whether it be a science research problem also have a problem industry which I'm gonna get the system to work using a learning algorithm um to those of you that are not currently doing research on this special I had one great way to do a project would be if you are applying the only out rooms to just pick a problem that you care about picking around that you find interesting and apply the many hours of that and play the ideas and see what happens arm and let's see oh and the goal of the project should really be for you to on do a publishable piece of research in machine learning okay um and if it goes to the course website are you actually find a list of the projects that students had done last year and so I'm holding this in my hand you can you can go go home later and take a look at it online but reading down those things I see that last year there were students dead zone applied learning our rooms to control the snake robot there is a few projects on improving learning algorithms arm does a project on flying autonomous aircraft there was a project that he done by RT Paul on on improving computer vision algorithms using machine learning their corporate projects on netflix rankings using learning algorithms arm few medical robotics ones on segmenting i altered segmenting pieces of the body using only our homes on one of musical instrument detection and other on RNA sequence alignment arm I don't know a few albums on understanding the brain no signs are actually quite a few projects are no signs of projects on understanding fMRI data and brain scans arm and so on on another project on market making the financial trading those interesting project on trying to use any albums to decide what is it that makes a person's face you know physically attractive and just learn the album optical illusions and so on the girls on the fun lots of fun projects and take a look on then yo come on come on your own ideas but whatever you find cool and interesting i hope you'll be able to make learning up that machine only project out of it yeah question oh yes thank you right so I'm practicing be done in groups of up to meaty pole so arm as part of forming study groups arm your later today as you get to know your classmates I definitely also encourage you to go grab two other people and then inform a group of up to three people for your project okay I'm just start brainstorming ideas for now amongst yourselves arm we can also come talk to me or the tears if you want to bring some ideas with us arm ok so one more organizational question on pure is how many of you know how many of you know math lab Wow cool quite a lot arm ok so as part of the show me of you know octave i have used after complicates a smaller number so as part of this horse arm especially in the home worlds will ask you to implement a few programs if you machine learning algorithms as part of the homeworks oh and most of those home worlds will be done in either MATLAB or in octave which is silver and there's some people call the free version of matlab which is sort of a sort of isn't oh so because for those of you that haven't seen matlab before our meeting once you have matlab is a programming I guess the programming language that makes it very easy to write code using matrices are performing you to write code for numerical routines to move data around to plot data arm and it's sort of an extremely easy to learn tool to use for implementing a lot of learning algorithms arm and for those of you in case somebody you want to work you know on your own home computer or something and you don't have a matlab license Oh for the purposes of this clause there's also just write them there's also a software package called octave that you can download for free on the internet and it has you know somewhat fewer features in matlab but it's free and for the purposes of this possible is work for just about everything arm so actually well so yeah just just a side comment for those of you that haven't seen that before I guess on once a colleague of mine at a different University and all that Stanford actually teaches you know teachers another machine learning course on a sort of for many years so one day he was in his office and then no student of his from like 10 years ago came into his office and he said no professor professor thank you so much for machine learning class I learned so much from it arm there's stuff that i learned your class they now use every day and it's helped me make lots of money and here's a picture of my years of my big holes are so my friend was very excited he said wow this is great i'm glad to hear this machine learning stuff is actually useful so so what was it that you know you know was it the logistic regression was it the pca was at the bayesian networks what was it that you learned it was so helpful and Justin said I was the matlab oh so for those of you that I don't know matlab yet I i hope to do learn it is not hard armed and why she have a short matlab tutorial in one of the discussion sections on for those of you that don't know it um ok the very last piece of logistical thing is the discussion sections are so discussion sections will be taught by the TAS and attendance of discussion sections is optional although the there they'll also be recorded and televised oh and we'll use the discussion sections me for two things are for the next two or three weeks we use the discussion sections to go over the prerequisites arm to this class or something you haven't seen your probability and statistics for a while then the algebra Oh we'll go over those in the discussion sections as a refresher for those of you that wants one um they turn this quarter will also use the discussion sections to go over extensions to the material that i'm teaching the main lecture zones and machine learning is a huge field enter a few extensions that we really want to teach but didn't have time in the main lectures for arm so they took this quarter we use the discussion sections to talk about things like convex optimization to talk about hidden Markov models which is a type of machine learning algorithm for modeling time series and a few other things of extensions the materials that i'll be covering in the main lectures oh and attendance at at the discussion sections with optional ok so that was all I has arm from the joysticks arm or thigh move on to start talking about about machines running let me check what questions you have yeah our something oh yeah let's see right so I would oh so the policy is a policy has been that you're welcome to use our but um i would strongly advise against the mean because in the last problems that we're to supply some code that will run in that letter and active but that would be somewhat difficult for you to translate that there would be some more painful for the transients are yourself so for the early assignments if you see you want to miss solution hard that's fine but I'm I that I think that was a she tell you where everything I I she I know are in that lab and I personally end up using matlab quite a bit more often for various reasons yeah oh except for the term project you're welcome to do it in smaller groups of free you're welcome to do it by yourself or in groups of two are grading is the same regardless of the group size so with a bit of a larger group you Perry I i recommend trying to form a team but it's actually certainly fine to do it in a smaller group if you want oh so there is no c programming in this class other than any day you may choose to do yourself in your project arm so that all the homeworks can be done in that lab or active and armed are the sea and and I guess the prerequisite is more the ability to understand big o notation and data sand and knowledge of what the data structure like a linked list or a Q or R or brand new treatments are also then your knowledge of c or java specifically looking and looking and incidents of project and what exactly will be testing over there eating methodology v 0 of the of the project yeah let me also that later let me in in a couple of ways i should give other hand out with some guidelines for the project but I think for now we think of the go is being to do on a cool piece of machine learning work that will let you experience you know the joys of machine learning first hand arm and and we really try to think about doing a published four piece of work on so many says we try to build a cool machine there in the application that's very the most common project are some sins we try to develop we try to improve state-of-the-art machine learning some point to some of those projects are also very successful Drake so I've been harder to do and there's also a smaller minority as soon as they are sometimes try to prove that you develop the theory of machine learning further we try to prove theorems about machine learning so they're they're they're usually great projects with all of those types of with applications machine any being the most common anything else ok call so that was it was it just takes on let's talk about learning algorithms it so can I have the laptop display these as a projective on a low on actually kitchen though the big screen yeah cool this amazing customer service thank you I see your pic cool ok is this mine ok thanks ok um big screen isnt working today but i hope you can read things on a smaller screen is out there actually because you're right i think I'm this room just got a new projector that I do someone sent you an exciting email was it just on Friday saying we're just going to new projector and this and then they said well the four thousand to one something rather brightness ratio I don't know if someone was very excited about the new project in this room but because we'll see that will see that in operation on Wednesday oh so arm start by talking about what machine learning is on what is one this machine learning he is a she can you can we can read the text out there raise your hand if if the text on the small speeds is legible ok cool mostly let's roll ok so i just read it out um so what this machine learning own way back in about nineteen fifty-nine also Samuel arm this is a defined machine learning and informally as a few the study that gives computers to learn view the study gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed um so awful Sammy oh so way back in history machine learning actually arm there's something very cool which was on here i'll check this program which would play games of checkers against itself arm and so because your computer can play thousands of gives us against itself rather be quickly on Arthur Samuel hope his program the thousands of games against the cell and over time it won't start to learn to recognize patterns which led to winds and patterns which led to losses and so over time to learn things like that you know G if i get a lot of my pieces taken by the opponent then are more likely to lose them with Georgie and I get my pieces in a certain position then i'm especially likely to win rather than this and so over time Arthur Samuel the checkers for around they will actually learn to play checkers by learning whether the board positions that are tend to be associated with winds and when whether the board positions that tends to be associated with losses on and way back in nineteen around nineteen fifty-nine the amazing thing about this was that arm his program actually learn to play checkers much better than after Samuel himself could so even today there are there are some people that say you know well computers can't do anything that they're not explicitly program to and also Samuels check this program was armed maybe the first I think really convincing reputation Rep reputation of this claim our name the arm after Samuel manager rather check his program they could play checkers much better than he personally and and doesn't instance of maybe computers learning to do things that they really were not program explicitly to arm here the more reason or more modern more formal definition of machine learning are you Tommy child arm who says that a well-posed learning problem on this is defined as follows she says that are a computer program is set to learn from the experience II respect to some toss tea and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P improves of experience e it so not only is the definition and even Ryan's arm so for example in in the case of checkers arm the experience II that the program has would be on the other the experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself so the toss t work was is the tossing checkers and the performance measure P will be something like you know the faction of games that wins against a certain set of human opponents and by this definition will say that often Samuels check this program has learned to play checkers ok so as an overview of what we're going to do in this cause this class of organized into four major sections are going to talk about four major topics and this is the first of which is on supervised learning and we could be an example of that arm so supposed to collect a data set of i'm holding prices and 12 years damage actually collected the data set from the last week or so to use these operator but suppose that arm you go to go to collect about you clicked on statistics about how much houses cost is a certain geographic area and dad the TA collected data from housing prices in portland oregon on so what you can do is let's say plot you know the square footage of the holes against the list price of the house and see so you get directly to the bunch of houses unless you get a data set like this with houses of different sizes that you know this is for different amounts of money arm now let's say that i'm trying to sell her house in the same areas Portland Oregon's and weather data comes from unless it i have a house that's you know this size and square footage arm and I want an album to tell me about how much should i expect my whole self or ok so the lot of ways to do this arm certain some of you may have seen elements of what I'm about to say before arm so one thing you could do is look at the stator and maybe for the streamline to it and then you know if your business my holes you made it look at the straight line and predict that my house is going to go for about that much money and on their other decisions you can make which we'll talk about later which is on well what if I don't want to for the straight guy maybe I see a shift for the quadratic function to it maybe that fish dated a little bit better on you notice if you do that the price of my high school's out of it so that'd be nice oh so and this sort of learning problem of learning to predict housing prices as an example of what's called a supervised learning problem arm and the reason it's called supervised learning is because we're providing the album a data set of a bunch of square petitions a bunch of housing sizes and as well as so the right answer of what the actual prices of a number of houses were right so we call the supervised learning because we're supervising the album or in other words were giving the album of the quotes right answer for number of houses and then we want the album to learn the association between the inputs and the outputs and to give us more of the right answers ok on it turns out this particular example they do here is an example of something called a regression problem and arm the term regression and refers to the fact that the variable you're trying to predict is a continuous value is a is a continuous value price home there's another class of supplies the only problems we can talk about which I classification problems arm and so in the consultation problem the variable you're trying to predict is the streets rather than continuous almond so this as one specific example that arm some actual standard data set you can download online that operate on the loss of machine learning people have played with let's say you collect the data set on breast cancer tumors and you want to know you know whether you want to learn the oven to predict whether or not a certain tumour as malignant malignant is the opposite of x rays and the lightning is any harmful back to run I'm saying we collect you know some number of features some of the properties of these two months and for the sake of you know this for the sake of so having a simple transformation let's just say that we're going to look at on the size of the tumor and depending on the size of the tumor we're trying to figure out whether or not the tumour as malignant or benign arm so tumors either malignant or benign and so the variable and the y axis is either 0 1 and so your data set me look like me look something like that that's 10 okay um and so this is an example of a classification problem where oh the variable you're trying to predict is the street value 0 1 on in fact more generally now there'll be many learning problems we're on we'll have more than one input variable more than one input feature and use more than one variable to try to predict say whether tumour as malignant or benign so for example on continue with this you may instead have a data set that looks like this i'm going to plot this data set in a slightly different way now and I'm making this dataset look much cleaner then then it really is a reality for inspiration that ok we're up for example maybe the classes indicate malignant tumors and he knows me indicate benign tumors and so you may have a dataset arm comprising patients at different ages and who have different tumor sizes and arm we're across indicates a malignant tumor and oh and the kids benign tumor you may want an algorithm to learn to predict given the new patient where their tumor is malignant or benign so for example of one of learning our may do is the community decide that you know a straight line like that separates the two clauses that he was really well and so if you have a new patients whose you know age and two messiahs fall over there then you may be into the album a predict that the tumor is benign rather than malignant ok so this is just another example of armed another supervised learning problem on and then another classification problem so it turns out that one of the issues and talk about making this cause Islam in this specific example we are going to try to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on two features are based on two inputs namely the age of the patient and the tumor size arm turns out that we look the real datasets you find that learning our firms often use other sets of features in the breast cancer this example you also use properties of the tumors like a clump thickness uniformity of cell size in the form here cell shape module adhesion and so on to the various met various other medical properties and so on and one of the most interesting things we'll talk about later this quarter is on one of your data doesn't lie in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional also given a finite-dimensional space but is it possible one of your data actually lies in an infinite-dimensional space right apart to hear a two-dimensional space I can't part with the dimensional space right and so it turns out that arm one of the most successful classes of machine learning algorithms something called support vector machines are actually take stator and works and and maps data to an infinite-dimensional space and then does classification using you know not to features like have done here but if the number of features and and now i should be one of the most fascinating things we talk about when we go deeply into classification algorithms the session question raised to think about how to even represent an infinite dimensional vector you know in in in computer memory you don't have an infinite amount of computers how to even represent a point there lives an infinite-dimensional space well we'll talk about that when we get to get to support vector machines okay so um let's see well so the second of them so that was supervised learning the second of the four major topics of this class will be learning theory arm so i have a friend who teaches math arm at a different University not understand that and when when you talk to him about you know his work and what he's really out to do on this friend of mine will cease am a professor and his friend of mine would so get the look and wondering his eyes and you tell you about how in this mathematical work he's you know he feels like he's discovering truth and beauty in the universe and then he says it in several really touching sincere way and then here's as you can see it in his eyes is this deep appreciation of you know the truth and beauty and universe as revealed to him by the math he does on in this class I'm not going to do any truth & Beauty home in this cause gonna stop on learning theory I'm to try to convey to you and understanding of how and why they're in the album's work arm so that we can apply these learning algorithms of as effectively as possible on so for example we will the turns out you can prove surprisingly deep theorems on our way can guarantee that are learning album world work so think about learning album for reading zip codes when can you prove a theorem guaranteeing that the learning album will be at least ninety nine point nine percent accurate on reading zip code is a somewhat surprising actually prove theorems showing when you can expect that to holds are also have also to delve into learning theory to try to understand what albums can approximate different functions well and when and I'm also try to understand things like how much training days had you need of how many examples of houses that I need in order for your learning album to recognize the pattern are between you know the square footage of the house and this housing presence how's answer questions like if you're trying to design the learning algorithm should you spend more time collecting more data or is it the case that you already have an update i would be a waste of time to try to it okay so um I think learning algorithms are very powerful tool on bed as I you know walk around industry in Silicon Valley or as I work with various students in CS NLCS um you find it that is often a huge difference between how well someone who really understands this stuff can apply a learning algorithm versus someone who you know sort of gets it sort of doesn't from the analogy I like to think of this is think of if imagine we're going to your carpentry school and 7 machine and go to carpentry school they can give you the tools of carpentry to give you a hammer eventually as a screwdriver or whatever arm but the master carpenter will be able to use those two spot better than most of us in this room so far as i know a carpet we can do things with a hammer and nail that I could possibly armed and actually like that machine learning to one thing that's sadly not too many horses on machinery knows how to take the two of the machine learning and really really apply them were all on the same way to the tune of machine learning are you know i'll say credit my bonds and the to the carpentry maybe a cardinal disagree but so a large how all of this to a large part of this class will be just giving you the rule to the Machine reading just the albums and so on arm but what I wanted but what I plan to do throughout this entire quarter and not just in the second learning theory but actually as a theme running through everything i do this quarter will be to try to convey to you arm the skills to really take the learning our room ideas and really to get into work on a problem are sort of half a metre you know stand here and and say what how big of you that is but when I want to walk around companies in Silicon Valley is completely not uncommon for me to see someone using some machine during the hour of them on and then explain to me what they've been doing for the last six months and I go gee you know this should have been obvious from the start that the last six months even wasting your time right and then and arm and arm so I go in this class running for the entire porter and not just on learning theory is actually now they need to give you the tools and machinery running but to teach all the user well and and some notice this is something that I'm really not many other classes teach so then just pump the cause I mean I really convincing is a huge new and so by the end of this part i hope you know all of you will be master competence I hope all will be really good at learning to find his learning out rooms I'm getting them to work amazing you all many problems okay um let's see so at least I sellable after learning theory arm there's another class of learning algorithms that I've been want to teach you about um and that's unsupervised learning so so you're a collar aight well on ponder on the other lower the Hydra an example like this right where you have you know a couple of features of covering four variables and so malignant tumors are benign tumors or whatever and there was an example of a supervised learning problem because you know the the data you have gives you the right onset of each of your patients the data tells you this patient and malignant tumors patient a benign tumor so happy right answers and and you want to the album just produce more of the same arm in contrast in an unsupervised learning them this is a solid a teacher we're on speaking loosely you're given a data set and I'm not going to tell you what the right answer is on you know any of the day they usually give your dataset i'm going to say which repeats find interesting structure in this data so that's the unsupervised learning problem where you have not given the right answer for everything armed sentries on there now from me um find structure in the data in the form of the data we are being partitioned into two fosters clustering would be one example is so one example of on an unsupervised learning problem arm so you can see this it turns out that these sorts of unsurprisingly albums are also used too many problems are there is a screenshot of this is a picture i got from soon leave as a as a PhD student here who is applying customized learning albums to try to understand gene data so is trying to look at jeans and individuals and group them into cluster space on based on the based on properties of what genes they respond to base and how's Holly jeans respond to different experiments arm another thing application of our trusty source of passing album is actually image processing this picture from Steve goals is another PhD students are it turns out what you can do is if you give this sort of data is an image to certain unsupervised learning algorithms they will then learn to group pixels together and say gee you know this set of pixels you two belong together and that's the pixels you two belong together and so on the images you see on the bottom and just and just barely see them on you know me so the images you see on the bottom are armed groupings are what the album has done to group different pixels together on a small display it might be easier to just to just look at the image on the right the two images of the bottom are two identical visualizations of the same grouping of on the the the pixels into into contiguous regions on and so it turns out that this sort of clustering algorithm the sort of unsupervised learning algorithm which suppose the group pixels together all turns out to be useful for many applications in vision and computer vision image processing on the show you one example there's a rather cool and that to citizens are 16 and then son here did on was given an image like this right this is so does actually picture taken on Stanford campus are you can apply that sort of clustering algorithm and you know group the picture into regions let me actually know that up so you can see it more clearly huh ok ok so in the middle you see a the lines of grouping the image together grouping the image into contiguous regions and what josh & Mindy was it and apply the learning our room to say on can we take this clustering and use it to build a model to build a 3d model of the world on and so using the clustering they didn't have a learning of them try to learn what this 3d structure of the world looks like so that they could come up with a 3d model you can drip dry food there are many people used to think it's not possible to take a single image and you build a 3d model but are using learning algorithm and that's a lot of cussing out on the first step they were able to just show you one example I like this this is a picture of stamping of our beautiful Stanford campus on so again taking the same sort of clustering algorithms you can have taken the same sort of unsupervised learning our room you can group the pixels in two different regions and using that as a pre-processing step they eventually built the sort of 3d model of Stanford campus no single picture you can sort of walk into this evening look around the campus ok this is actually turned out there mix of supervised and unsupervised learning but the unsupervised learning the soul of clustering was the first step arm so turns out there are details of unsupervised clustering algorithms are actually routinely used for many different things like organizing computing clusters on social network analysis market segmentation and so if you're a marketer you want to divide your secular your market into different segments of different groups of people to market to them separately up even for astronomical data analysis and an understanding how galaxies are for these are just as soon as a small sample of the applications of uncivilized lower the arms of clustering algorithms that they will talk about it in this class um just one particularly cool example of an unsupervised learning algorithm they want to tell you about on and to motivate that will tell you about the couple's don't consider what's called the cocktail party problem which is some imagine there's some cocktail party and a lot of people standing all over and you know how this is very very large party you know everyone's talking it can be something very hard to hear even a person in front of use it so imagine the large cocktail party lots of people so the problem is they're all of these people talking no can you can you separate out the person the the voice of just the person you're interested in talking to it was with revolvers lot of background noise so i should pay you to show you a specific example in the second on but you know he has a cocktail party um as I guess all the spots the attended by just two people arm and arm but we're going to do is we'll put two microphones in the room ok and so you know because the microphones are just slightly different distances to the two people and the two people we speak and slightly different volumes each microphone will pick up on an overlapping combination of these two peoples voices but arm but they are so slightly different overlapping voices so speaker one's voice maybe more allowed on microphone one this week at Sue's was me allows a microphone to whatever arm the question is given these microphone recordings can you separate out the original speakers voices so I'm playing some audio clips they were collected by t1d at UCSD arm then she pay for you the original on your microphone recordings from this cocktail party so this is the microphone one mine those three worlds 56 the original whoever has this is a fascinating cocktail party of people coming from one to two minutes this is the second annual Pine doors today cuadros not say that the torture normal is ok so right and not supervised learning we don't know what the right answer is right so we're going to do is take our exactly the two microphone recording as you just heard and give it to an unsupervised learning algorithm arm until the album which piece discover structure in the data from your what structure is there in this data oh man we actually don't know what their answer is because it offhand so give the stator 21 surprise learning algorithm and what the oven doesn't this case and discover that this data can actually be explained by two independent speakers speak in the same time and they can further on separate out the two speakers for you so here's some open one of the algorithm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a 9 10 there was a second uno dos tres cuatro Cinco seis see the auto oil it is ok and so the oven discovers that g the best the structure underlying data is read that there are two souls as a sound and here they are on show you one more example this is a 10 second this is a second night it's a different a pair of microphones holdings so the poor guy is now the coffee party he's talking to his radio the second recording yeah right now we get this data to the same arm unsupervised learning algorithm is the album is called independent component analysis and later this quarter you see why I'm at the office the following one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and that's the second okay so it turns out that are beyond you're solving with the cocktail party of Harlem this specific positive unsurprisingly our rooms are also applied to a bunch of other problems like in text processing or understanding functional brain imaging data like to make a toast for larger p.m. ET data well we'll talk about that more when we could describe I see a more independent component analysis algorithms which is what you just saw on and that's an aside you know this this is our room i just showed you it seems like it must be a pretty complicated our way to take these overlapping audio three and separate them out sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do even asked how complicated is it really to implement an hour like this oh it turns out if you do the matlab you can do than one line of code home so i got this from sanrio wise at toronto your toronto and the example I showed you actually use the more complicated i see our incentives but that nonetheless you know I guess this is why arm for this pause i'm going to ask you to do the most your program in matlab an octave on because on if you try to implement the same album in C or Java or something that you know i can tell you from personal painful experience you had their writing pages and pages of color rather than those of a few lines of code although i should mention days on it did take researchers you know many many years to come up with that one line of code so it is not not easy on so that was on supervised learning and then the loss of the four major topics wants to tell you about is some reinforcement learning arm and this refers to problems where are you don't do one shot decision making so for example in the supervised learning cancer prediction problem you know you have a patient come in you predicted the cancer is malignant or benign and then based on your prediction you know maybe the patient lives or dies and that's it right so you make a decision and then and then as a consequence you the caller ID on our reinforcement learning problems you are usually use asked to make a sequence of decisions of the time so for example arm assembly that my students and I work on on if i give you the keys to an autonomous helicopter we watch out the soul doctor you know here hearing here at Stanford oh how do you write a parent to make it fly right you notice that if you make a wrong decision on the helicopter you know the consequence of cashing it may not happen until much later and the fact usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash our doctor but conversely you also need to make whole sequence of good decisions in order to fly home after really well so let me show you some fun videos of you know learning our room was flying helicopters on this is a video of our helicopter standard flying using a controller that was learned using a reinforcement learning algorithm so this is done on the standard football fields will zoom on the camera in the second associated trees planted the sky so this so this is one of the most of difficult aerobatic maneuvers build on a helicopter on the computer control and it was this controller which is very very hard for humans to sit down the right aisle was learned using one of these reinforcements uniforms um just worried about that the the basic idea behind the reinforcement learning algorithm business idea was color award function um one way to think about it is imagine you're trying to train a dog on so every time your dog does something good you say you know good dog and you reward the dog every time you go out there something bad you go bad dog right and hopefully over time your dog will you learn to do the right things to get more positive rewards to get more of the good dogs and to get few of the bad dogs so that when we teach helicopter to fly or any of these robots and so the same thing I'm every time the whole public crashes we go bad helicopter Oh and every time it does the right thing would be a good helicopter and over time it learns how to control ourselves as you get more of these positive ones on there for someone is what this is I think of it as a way for you to specify what you want done you have to specify what is a good dog was a bad dog behavior and it is up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize arm you're the good dr. Ward signals and minimize it bagged are punishments um so just to just show you I turns out for some learning is applied you know to other problems in your body is supplied to things and we're crawling and so on there's just close the show videos so let me just show a bunch of them on this robot was actually on this learning arms she implemented by our head ta Zico Oh programming a four legged dog on because Sam's husband Sam driving the stars also work on projects and and peer review and our micro and a few others arm but i guess this really is a good or bad arguments 0 by dog on a second video on the right on some of the students is Peter's ecole tonker working on a robotic snake on in using learning our rooms to teach a snake robot to climb over obstacles on the lower left this is kind of fun example on our 16 and Jeff Michaels is learning outros the teacher car how the driver you know reasonably high speeds are roads are avoiding obstacles on and arm on the lower rights there's a robot programmed by piece to the ocean our identity teach sort of somewhat strange to configure a robot arm how to get on top of the article how to get over an obstacle sorry i know the video is kind of small how can sort of see it ok I think all of these are real balls that arm I think are very difficult to hand code the controller for but using these sorts of learning algorithms on you can in relatively short order on get a robot to do you often for the amazing things ok so that was most of what i want to say today just a couple more lost things but some will just check what questions you have right now yeah ok so are there is no questions no I mean I just close with two reminders which are armed after class today or as you know start to talk about top of other people in this class um we just encourage you again to start to form project partners to try to find project partners to do your project with arm and also are there is a good time to start forming study groups you to talk to your friends suppose the news group but just encourage you to try to start to do both of those today form study groups and try to find two other project partners so thank you looking forward to teaching spots and I'll see you in a couple of base
